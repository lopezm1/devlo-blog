This blog is dedicated to our experiences in the software industry. 

## **Who Are We?**

We're just two brothers who share a love for all aspects of software development. 

**Miguel Lopez** is a cloud engineer, automation ethusiast and a Software Consultant @[KAR Auction Services](https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/kar-auction-services-journey-to-the-cloud-bap201-reinvent-2017). He loves studying solution architecture and building event-driven backends using AWS and serverless technology. When he's not geeking out, he likes hiking, attending sporting events and happy hours.

**Sergio Lopez** is a full stack engineer, SPA specialist and Developer @[Choice Hotels](https://www.choicehotels.com/). He loves to create maintainable SPAs using javascript frameworks like angularJS and reactJS. When he's not geeking out, he loves being an on-field mascot for the @[Arizona Diamondbacks](http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/ari/fan_forum/legends_sweeps.jsp).

## **What does DevLo mean?**
